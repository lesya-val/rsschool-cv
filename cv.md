### Briefly About Myself:
I'm a second-year student of a technical university in the speciality "Software engineering".  
A year ago, I first encountered Frontend-development in a training practice. After passing it, I realized that this is exactly the direction in which I want to develop.  
Since then, I've been spending my free time studying web-development, and I'm not going to stop.  
I hope that my desire to acquire new skills and the ability to approach work responsibly will help me become an experienced Frontend-developer and get a job.
